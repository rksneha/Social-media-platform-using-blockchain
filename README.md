# Social-media-platform-using-Blockchain
A security based project that lets users create accounts and post on social media platform built on blockchain.

## ABOUT:
Blockchain technology refers to the decentralized ledger of cryptocurrency transactions, and it is
opposed to the centralized bookkeeping strategy that traditional banks use. Since bitcoin and
other types of cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology, each new transaction or a set of
transactions are stored in a block. While the block is separate, the entire cryptocurrency chain
needs to approve it. This process makes the use of cryptocurrencies secure and transparent.
Blockchain technology enables individuals to have better privacy when using Internet-based
technology. Unlike other social media websites, any social media platform built on
blockchain restricts ads and control over privacy data by giant marketers or hackers. Another
issue we face with social media is post spamming and fake accounts. This project has been
implemented with a hope to eradicate this issue from the history of social media platforms.
